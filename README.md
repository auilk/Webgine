# Webgine

**Webgine** is a personal project aimed at learning JavaScript by building a simple 2D game engine that runs in the browser. This project helps develop JavaScript skills while creating a fun and functional tool. Webgine also uses WebGL for rendering, providing an opportunity to learn WebGL alongside JavaScript.

## Project Goals

- **Learn JavaScript**: Improve proficiency by building a hands-on project.
- **Learn WebGL**: Gain experience with WebGL for rendering graphics.
- **Build a Game Engine**: Create a basic 2D engine with features like rendering, collision detection, and asset management.
- **Browser-Based**: Ensure everything runs in the browser without external dependencies.
- **Simple and Beginner-Friendly**: Keep the project lightweight and focus on the essentials.

## Planned Features

1. **Rendering**: Draw 2D sprites using WebGL.
2. **Collision Detection**: Implement basic Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) collision detection.
3. **Game Logic**: Allow users to script their games using JavaScript.
4. **Asset Management**: Load and store assets like textures and shaders.
